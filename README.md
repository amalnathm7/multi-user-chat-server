# multi_user_chat_server

#### Problem Statement

Write the client and server programs, where the server can exchange text with many client processes. A client process starts the communication 
with an input "start". After this, the client process waits for the answer from the server. If server permits, it can further send any text message 
(with restriction of not more than 25 words in a day). The communication goes on in this way until the client process sends the message "stop" to 
the server.

#### Result

The given problem is solved using socket programming in C language.
